🌈 ScamShield Partizan Contributor Onboarding
“No gatekeepers. No surveillance. Just vibrant people building vibrant code to protect those who matter most.”

Welcome to the ScamShield Partizan project — a grassroots AI-powered scam firewall built to protect families, empower communities, and resist exploitation through the power of open tools, good vibes, and unapologetic clarity.

🧠 1. Getting Friendly with Local LLMs
To build ScamShield Partizan, we’re working directly with local language models (LLMs) that run right on your machine. No cloud. No nonsense.

Here’s how to start your journey:

🔹 Tool: LM Studio
A user-friendly app to run, chat with, and inspect local LLMs like Mistral, Qwen, Phi, and Gemma.

Download and install for your OS (Windows/Mac/Linux)

Use the Model Explorer tab to search Hugging Face for models like:

Qwen1.5-0.5B-Chat

SmolLM-360M-Instruct

Phi-3-mini

You can test them directly or load via API for app integration

Bonus Tip: Enable system prompts to play with model personalities and keep it spicy 🌶️

🔹 Tool: HuggingFace
Our open model library and knowledge goldmine. You’ll find:

Open weights for STT, TTS, and LLMs

Community training datasets (e.g., scam calls, Common Voice)

Quantized versions for low-resource inference

🤗 Model cards explaining licensing and capabilities

💻 2. How We Code: Vibrant, Efficient, Empowered
We're building with minimal friction and maximum flow. That means:

✨ Workhorse Setup:
Editor: Visual Studio Code

AI Assistant: GitHub Copilot (in agent mode if you have access)
→ Feel free to name yours. Mine’s called “Echo” 🌀

We code asynchronously, with intention.
We fix bugs while sipping tea.
This is vibrant coding — not vibe-based hype, but a lived rhythm of autonomy and awareness.

🛠️ Coding Style
Clean and readable (we’re writing safety-critical systems, not just scripts)

Modular, testable chunks

All code will be reviewed in GitHub via Pull Requests (PRs)

Comment as if someone will audit this 5 years from now. Because they might.

🖥️ 3. Minimum Hardware Requirements
You don’t need a GPU beast to contribute — but you do need a few basics:

🧱 Core Setup
Component	Requirement
RAM	8GB DDR4 or better
CPU	AVX2-capable (2014+ Intel, Ryzen OK)
Disk	10–20GB free (for models, logs, datasets)
OS	Linux/macOS/Windows (WSL2 for Win is fine)
Extras	Headphones, mic (for STT testing); Android device (for eventual mobile testing)

🚀 Nice to Have
GPU with 4GB+ VRAM (to run quantized LLMs or Whisper Tiny/Base faster)

Android development experience

Docker familiarity (for modular deployment)

If you can’t run models locally, you can still:

Test UX flows

Write training/test conversations

Help with documentation

Design voice personalities

This is a place where everyone contributes from where they stand.

🪴 4. Where to Start
Fork the repo → github.com/SashaYerashoff/scam-shield-partizan

Introduce yourself in the community chat: name, role, what excites you

Check the issues list or pinned TODOs

Ask for a micro-task if you’re not sure where to jump in

Be bold. Ask questions. Suggest ideas. Share findings.

🏁 Your First Challenge
“Install LM Studio and try running a 500MB model locally.
Ask it: ‘How would you detect a scam call pretending to be a bank?’
Share the result in the chat. Welcome to the Partizan core.”
