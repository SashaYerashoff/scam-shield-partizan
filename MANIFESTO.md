# ScamShield Partizan Manifesto

We don’t teach people to spot scams. We teach scams not to bother.

Let's take a burden of identity proof to the caller!

Modern scams and telemarketers are fast, intelligent, and relentless. But so are we.

ScamShield Partizan is a declaration of **digital resistance**. A grassroots defense system made by real people, for real people. No tracking. No ads. No cloud surveillance.

We will build a **barrier between scams and telemarketers, and the people least able to defend themselves** — with tech that’s:
- Multilingual
- Transparent
- Completely free
- Always under community control

---

## 👀 Our Targets
- Elderly users who don’t understand voice deepfakes or isn't aware on the latest scam scheme.
- Isolated people at risk of manipulation
- Anyone who is tired to think if this call is scam, some unnecessary shit they want to sell you, or is aligned with Your goals and is actually relevant.

## ⚙️ Our Weapons

- 🧠 Tiny LLMs that act smarter than regex
- 🎙️ Real-time speech recognition and synthesis
- 🧱 Local pattern databases
- 🛰️ Optional RAG modules with threat signatures
- 🤖 Behavior-level anomaly detection

## 🏴 Our Principles

1. **All computation must be optional, local, and offline-first.**
2. **No cloud vendor shall be trusted blindly.**
3. **Everyone deserves digital protection, not just the rich.**
4. **Transparency beats convenience.**
5. **The AI should be the gatekeeper, not the gossip.**

## 📌 Our Promise

We will:
- Keep the system open and impossible to monetize
- Never collect user data without informed consent
- Make the source easy to audit, fork, and improve
- Keep grannies and hackers equally welcome

We believe that the *best way to stop predators* is to make exploitation **inconvenient**, **unprofitable**, and ideally — **a waste of time**.

Let’s make digital safety boring and automatic.  
Let’s make scams fail before they begin.  
Let’s protect our families — together.

**Join the resistance. Build the shield. 🛡️**
